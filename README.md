# SwiftUI Firebase Application

This SwiftUI mobile application integrates Firebase services for authentication and real-time database interactions. It is developed as part of an academic project submission.

**Disclaimer: This project is intended solely for evaluation by the professor. It is not intended for distribution, reproduction, or any other purpose beyond academic assessment.**

## Introduction

This application demonstrates the integration of Firebase services with a SwiftUI app. It includes user authentication, Firestore database interactions, and real-time messaging capabilities.

## Features

- **Email**: `micheal@expert.com` (for expert account) or `c1@clients.com` (for client account)
- **Password**: `123456` (for both accounts)

*Note: If you encounter any issues logging in with the test credentials, please use the Sign Up option to create a new account.*

## Firebase Security Rules

For the purpose of this evaluation, the Firebase security rules are configured to allow authenticated users to interact with the database. The rules ensure:

- **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can read and write data.
- **Data Privacy**: Users can access their own profiles and create requests.

## App Icon

An app icon is included in the project and is properly configured in the asset catalog.

## Notes

- **Data Privacy**:

  - No sensitive personal data is stored within the database.

- **Testing Considerations**:

  - Feel free to create, read, update, and delete data within the app to evaluate its functionality.
